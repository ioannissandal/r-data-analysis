# Data Analysis with R â€“ EDA & Visualization

This project includes a series of data analysis exercises using R and RStudio, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and visualization techniques across multiple datasets.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Activities
- Data import and structure exploration (`str()`, `summary()`, `head()`)
- Handling missing values and outliers
- Variable description and classification
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, sd, IQR)
- Correlation matrices and scatterplots
- Regression models and ROC curve analysis
- Dynamic reports with R Markdown

## ðŸ“Š Packages Used
- `tidyverse`
- `ggplot2`
- `caTools`, `ROCR`, `pROC`
- `knitr`, `rmarkdown`

## ðŸŽ¯ Outcome
Developed strong understanding of data exploration and reporting using R, built multiple regression models and evaluated them using ROC curves and statistical metrics. Produced reproducible reports suitable for academic or professional use.
